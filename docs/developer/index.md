# Developing your Software Delivery Machine

Are you a developer who wants to streamline your team's work?

Are you charged with improving Developer Experience or Developer Productivity at your organization?

Do you bear responsibility or oversight for more repositories than you can inspect? Are checks and
approvals slowing your teams' progress?

Atomist is a platform for automating many parts of development,
especially tasks that are painful at scale.

This includes collaborating with people in chat, investigating code across many repositories, applying changes across them, delivering code,
 and many other automations.

## About this Developer Guide

The Developer Guide section of these docs is for people writing automations that run on the Atomist platform.

If your team uses Atomist, and you want to understand the built-in features, start in [Using Atomist](../user/index.md).

If you want to see examples of the kinds of automation Atomist makes feasible, this is a good place to be.

## Instructions

Once you have a local SDM up and running, here are some things you can do with it:

* Add a [chat command](commands.md)
* Add an [autofix](autofix.md)
* Add a [code inspection](inspect.md)
* Add a [custom goal](goal.md) for your team's specific need

Also check out some [fuller tutorials](tutorials.md)

## Concepts

In your own SDM, you have many tools available to automate your organization or team's software development (including delivery). To provide all the options, while making the common work easier,
we layer some abstractions.

![Layers of libraries: Atomist Service talks to automation-client, which underlies SDM, which
underlies all the packs, including sdm-pack-aspect which is the focus of org-vizualizer](img/layers-of-libs.png)

The Atomist service provides triggering, [chat integration](../user/slack.md), and a [GraphQL interface](graphql.md) to events and the context around them. Your software delivery machine connects to that service. This connection is handled in the `@atomist/automation-client` [library][npm-automationclient]. That library works in terms of commands (which people trigger from chat) and events. It also interfaces with source control; it clones repositories, makes commits, pushes them, etc.

[npm-automationclient]: https://npmjs.com/@atomist/automation-client (Automation Client library)
[npm-sdm]: https://npmjs.com/@atomist/sdm (SDM library)

On top of that, the `@atomist/sdm` [library][npm-sdm] provides a domain model for software delivery. This library understands many of the events that people want to react to, including new [issues](event.md#issues), [new repositories](event.md#repository-creation), and the all-important push. The push triggers [PushRules](set-goals.md), which result in [Goals](goal.md), which the SDM knows how to execute. The Goals include familiar activities like Build and Deploy, plus
activities that you won't see in older build tools: [AutoCodeInspect](inspect.md), [Autofix](autofix.md), and [Fingerprint](fingerprint.md), for instance.

In addition, there are extension packs that build on the abstractions in the SDM. There is a pack for [build](../pack/build.md) functionality. There are packs to help with languages like [Java](../pack/spring.md) or [Node](../pack/node.md). There are packs specific to deployment targets like [Kubernetes](../pack/kubernetes/index.md) or [Cloud Foundry](../pack/pcf.md). You can create packs and share them with the community.

Learn more about the high-level concepts in [Architecture](architecture.md).
