Fingerprints detect important changes to code and configuration. They ensure that critical, potentially breaking changes donâ€™t slip by unnoticed and cause outages or other problems. You can see how this looks in Slack in the following video snippet:

Fingerprints are calculated by extracting specific, logically related fragments of code, normalizing and sorting them in a deterministic order, and then computing a SHA. Fingerprints are computed on the difference or impact between the commit and its parent commit. The fingerprints are calculated on each commit. If a change from previous version is detected, Atomist alerts you in Slack and in some cases sets the GitHub build status to blocked.

## Available Fingerprints

Atomist offers the fingerprints listed in the table below.

Entry | Description
------|------------
`build` | Build file (Travis and CircleCI)
`docker` | Dockerfile base image
`props` | Application property and YAML files used by Spring Boot
`rest` | Spring MVC REST endpoints
`plugins` | Maven plugins
`plugsMgt` | Maven plugin management
`deps` | Maven dependencies
`depsMgt` | Maven dependency management

## Appearance

Below is an example fingerprint rendering in Slack. It shows that both the build configuration and the configured plugins changed. Notice that the fingerprint has done its job here: the fingerprint detected a change to the build file that the commit message neglected to mention.

## Configuration

The fingerprint configuration file is located in the atomist-config repo:

`https://<your-repo>/atomist-config/blob/master/fingerprints.json`
