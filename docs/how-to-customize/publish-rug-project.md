To make new or modified Rug scripts in your Rug project available
in your team, you will need to publish the Rug project.

!!! missing "Prerequisites"
    Completing the [Getting Started Guide][getting-started]
    and the [Rug CLI setup][cli-setup],
    [Rug project creation][create-rug], and [TypeScript setup][ts]
    tutorials are prerequisites for this tutorial.

[getting-started]: /getting-started/index.md
[cli-setup]: setup-cli.md
[create-rug]: create-rug-project.md
[ts]: setup-typescript.md

## Install Dependencies

The Rug project contains [NPM][npm] module dependencies that need to
be installed before we publish.  Run the following command from within
your Rug project directory to install its dependencies.

```console
$ ( cd .atomist && npm install )
```

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/ (NPM Modules)

## Identify Slack Team ID

Since you may be in multiple Slack teams that have the Atomist Bot
installed (for example, atomist-community public Slack team and your
own Slack team), you will need to tell the Rug CLI which team to
publish this Rug project to.

You can find the team ID from within your Slack team. Send this
message in `#general` or any channel that the Atomist Bot has been
invited to.

```
@atomist team
```

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/atomist-team.png" alt="List of project generators" class="ss-medium">
</div>

In this example, the Slack team ID is "T489LV5QF".

## Publish

Now that you know your Slack team ID, you can publish your Rug project
archive.  Pass the lower-cased version of your Slack team ID to the
`rug publish` command like this.

```console
$ rug publish --id=t489lv5qf
