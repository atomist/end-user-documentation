-   A [Slack][slack] team where you
    have [permissions to add an app][slack-app]

## Slack

Chat is one of the main interfaces for Atomist.  Currently we support
the [Slack][slack] chat platform.  You can use any Slack team you are
currently a member of with Atomist.  If you do not currently use
Slack, don't have [permissions to add an app][slack-app] to your
existing Slack team, or prefer to use a new Slack team with Atomist,
you can <a href="https://slack.com/create" alt="create Slack team"
title="Create a Slack team" target="_blank">create a new Slack
team</a> for free.

## GitHub

Atomist wants to get to know your code.  Currently Atomist integrates
with [GitHub.com][github] and [GitHub Enterprise][ghe].

If you already have a GitHub.com account, you can use it with
Atomist. You will need to be a member of one or more GitHub
organizations where you have permission
to [authorize OAuth Apps][github-oauth]. If you do not have a
GitHub.com account, you can [create a GitHub account][github-join] for
free. If you are not a member of a GitHub organization, you
can [create a public org for free][github-org].

<!-- Single repository? -->

If you use GitHub Enterprise, please [get in touch][contact] with us.

After you add Atomist to your Slack team, the Atomist Bot will prompt
you to authorize Atomist with GitHub.
