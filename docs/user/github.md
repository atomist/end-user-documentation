Atomist helps you work with GitHub in three ways:

1.  Atomist analyzes the code across your GitHub organization to surface
    aspects that reveal [drift](drift-report.md) and other concerns.
1.  Atomist surfaces your team's development activity, such as pushes,
    pull requests, or issues, in the Atomist web interface in chat.  This
    visibility is enabled via webhooks.
2.  Atomist allows you to take action in your repositories, creating
    issues, merging pull requests, even releasing services to
    production, from the Atomist web interface or in chat.  To release the
    full ChatOps power of Atomist, each user on your team will
    independently authorize Atomist -- this means that your users
    remain within the boundaries of the existing GitHub security
    model.  Atomist acts on _behalf_ of your users, not _instead_ of
    them.

## Webhooks

<!-- TODO as a GitHub app, is this still true? Ask dd to look at this page -->

Atomist receives events from GitHub via [webhooks][].  To
ease adoption across your organization, installing an organization
webhook is recommended.  To try Atomist out on a small scale, you can
install webhooks repository by repository.

[webhooks]: https://help.github.com/articles/about-webhooks/ (GitHub - Webhooks)

### Organization webhooks

GitHub organization members that have the [owner role][owners] are
allowed to configure organization webhooks.  This is convenient
because it only has to be configured once; however, you will require a
user who has the `Owner` role in your GitHub organization.

```
you> @atomist enroll org
```

When you choose to enroll a GitHub organization, you will most likely
be prompted to authorize a new scope (Atomist only asks for new scopes
when explicitly required).  The *admin:org_hook* is required when
enrolling a new GitHub organization.

If you are a member of more than one GitHub organization, Atomist
asks you to choose which organization to enroll.

### Repository webhooks

If your team does not use a GitHub organization account, you can
choose to configure webhooks on individual repositories owned by your
user account.

## GitHub user authorization

When the Atomist bot first arrives in a Slack workspace, it will send
a direct message to the authorizing user, requesting that they
authorize Atomist to access GitHub on their behalf.

This same dialog will be shown to users anytime Atomist detects that
an automation needs to access GitHub as that user.  Every member of
the workspace must individually opt in.  Atomist will display this
option each time an un-authorized user runs a command that requires a
GitHub authorization.  Users can ask for their current GitHub
authorization status by running:

```
you> @atomist github
```

Atomist will send a direct message to this user with their current
GitHub authorization status.
