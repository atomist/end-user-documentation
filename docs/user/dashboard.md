you can view and manage drift, see some notifications, run GraphQL queries against your data, and administer your
Atomist workspace.

## GraphQL

Atomist constructs a graph of your organization's events, so that you can get the context you need to act on them. For instance, a push is linked to commits which link to people which link to chat users that you can DM. Issues are linked to commits that reference them.
