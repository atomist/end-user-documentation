In the [Getting Started][gs] section, you connected Atomist to your
development systems and learned how to use some of the built-in
functionality that Atomist provides.  These tutorials will teach you
how to extend and customize Atomist, tailoring it to your own
development workflow and processes.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you've completed all the [Getting Started][gs] steps so that Atomist Bot is in your
Slack team and connected to your GitHub account.

The tutorials are organized so that the first few ensure that you are set up for
writing and publishing Rug scripts.
