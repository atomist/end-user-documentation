We provide a generator that can be run from your Slack team to create a new Rug project using standard setup, sensible defaults, and starter Rugs.

!!! tip ""
    Completing the [Getting Started][getting-started] steps is a prerequisite for this tutorial.

[getting-started]: /getting-started

In `#general` or any channel in your Slack team that Atomist Bot has been invited to, type this message:

```
@atomist generators starter
```

The Bot will show generators with the tag `starter` like following.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/new-rug-generator.png" alt="New Rug Generator" class="ss-medium">
</div>

Click on the "Generate project" button for the `NewStarterRugProject` generator.

The Atomist Bot will respond with a message telling you what project
generator you created and then start a [thread][] off that message to
gather the information it needs to generate the project.  Click now on
the "1 reply" link below the message to open up the thread in Slack.
You will see that the Atomist Bot has asked you a question in the
thread.

<div class="ss-container">

</div>

Type in a name for your new project and press `Enter`.  A new repository with this
name will be created, so the project name must be a valid GitHub repository name.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/create-rug-project-parameters.png" alt="Rug project parameters all set" class="ss-x-small">
</div>

Now click on "Generate project" and the Bot will create the project in a new GitHub repository, then confirm with a message similar to the following.

<div class="ss-container">
  <img src="../images/rug-project-creation-response.png" alt="Rug project creation response from Atomist" class="ss-medium">
</div>

You now have a starter Rug project to write new Rugs in. Click on the project link
to see your project in GitHub.

We recommend you make a local clone of this new repository for use in other tutorials.
