We provide a utility called [k8svent][] that sends events from your
Kubernetes cluster(s) to Atomist so skills can take action.

Here is a video walking you through setting up the Atomist Kubernetes
integration.

## Connect to Kubernetes

1.  From **Manage > Integrations**, choose the Kubernetes integration.
2.  Enter a name for the Kubernetes cluster you want to add.
    Typically this is something like "production" or "k8s-testing".
3.  Click **Add**.
4.  Copy the installation instructions from the popup.
5.  Paste the installation command into a terminal and hit **Enter**.

The installation command will use the [`kubectl`][kubectl] utility and
your current Kubernetes configuration context to install the Atomist
utility.  So make sure you have `kubectl` installed and configured to
operate on the cluster you are adding.

    If you get an error when trying to install the Atomist Kubernetes
