Microgrammars are *"partial grammars designed to extract
checker-specific features only"*.

When there is no existing Rug [extension][extensions] and plain file
manipulation is too clumsy and random,
the [microgrammar (pdf)][microgrammar] support in Rug provides an
effective way of declaring a way to safely select and extract a
portion of a file so that it can be inspected and manipulated by your
Rugs.

The Atomist implementation of microgrammars is undergoing rapid
development and change.  Please see
the [`@atomist/microgrammar`][microgrammar-ts] TypeScript
implementation for the latest documentation and usage.
