# Welcome

[Atomist][www] is a development automation platform for modern teams. Our software projects
are no longer few, and we can no longer hand-feed them every style and dependency update.
we do not ask
people to track the status of all the code that our organization owns.
We no longer carve an individual delivery pipeline for each new service. It is time to write
software at a higher level, with development automation.

We re-imagined how code maintenance should work, with high level visibility, investigation,
 and even updates driven by code. Write functions to read and understand code, and then
 leverage that understanding across your organization.
 Write functions that connect to people, in chat:
 let the team make the decisions, while automation does the neverending work.

We re-imagined how software delivery should work and how you use it. The result
is a powerful event-driven approach, with an integrated data model across all
stages of delivery, a programmable interface to automate delivery in code, and
native ChatOps integration to make delivery more collaborative.

Atomist enables [Self-Service Software Delivery][sssd] so that you can focus on
creating great software, automatically delivered by a powerful platform that
understands your projects.

## Where to Start

Developers can do a thousand things with the Atomist platform. We recommend starting with:

Find and track technology drift within your organization.

* [Get Started][getting-started] in our web interface to investigate your GitHub organizations.
* [Try org-visualizer locally][quick-start] to investigate repositories on your laptop or anywhere on GitHub. Create custom functions for what you want to know about your code.

If your team already uses Atomist -

* [Using Atomist][user] - learn about Atomist user interfaces and how to use them

For everything else (delivery! project creation!) -

* [Developer Guide][dev-guide] - learn about Atomist concepts and architecture, and SDM development
