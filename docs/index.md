# Hello and welcome to Atomist ðŸ‘‹

!!! important
    In April 2020, we introduced a new way of using the Atomist platform,
    called [Skills][skills]. If you're looking for SDM documentation,
    you'll find it in the [SDM Guide][sdm-guide].

[Atomist][www] helps you improve your developer and DevOps experience.
We're an automation platform-as-a-service helping developers and
DevOps engineers automate important tasks and share knowledge in code.

If you're new to Atomist or learning about skills for the first time,
the [Getting Started][getting-started] guide will help you get up and
running quickly.

## What's a Skill

Skills are pre-built automations that you simply configure and use.

Use skills from our [catalog][] to scan for secrets in code,
streamline code review with automatic merging and cleanup, keep your
dependencies up-to-date automatically and more. [See all skills >>][catalog]

Skills are triggered by events from your existing tools like a commit,
build, deployment, or on a schedule. Skills use integrations to
connect to tools like [GitHub][github], [Slack][slack], [Kubernetes][k8s], and more.

[slack]: integration/slack.md (Atomist Slack Integration)
[k8s]: integration/kubernetes.md (Atomist Kubernetes Integration)
