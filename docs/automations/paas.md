# Running Automation Clients

You can run automation clients in many different environments, ranging from your laptop
or data center to Platform-as-a-Service offerings like Heroku and Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

Atomist also supports running clients as Docker containers. This allows you
to operate them in Kubernetes clusters or Google Container Engine, for example.

This document explains various ways to run automation clients.

## Running Locally

The easiest way to run an automation client is to start it up on your local
development machine. 

Running the automation client locally is extremely helpful
during development of your automations. 
* You can debug commands and event handlers using local development tools 
like Visual Studio Code and Google Chrome. 
* You can iterate rapidly because there is no deployment and only a minimal build process.

If you bootstrapped your client project using an Atomist seed and
generator, start the client by running the following commands:

```
npm run compile && npm start
```

By default, the client process runs on port `2866`.

!!! note
    The automation client requires an open internet connection to
    `https://automation.atomist.com` to successfully and register event
    subscriptions.

## Cloud Foundry

To push your automation client to an instance of Pivotal Cloud
Foundry, you need an account on the instance you want to target and
you must have the [Cloud Foundry CLI][cf-cli] installed.

For detailed information about the deployment process, consult
the [Cloud Foundry documentation][cf-docs].

A push to Cloud Foundry needs some additional meta data in your
project.  First you need to create a [`manifest.yml`][cf-manifest]
file in the root of your client:

```yaml
applications:
- name: lifecycle-automation
  command: node node_modules/.bin/atomist-client
  memory: 128M
  routes:
  - route: lifecycle.atomist.io
  buildpack: https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack
  env:
    SUPPRESS_NO_CONFIG_WARNING: true
    NODE_ENV: production
```

!!! note
    Technically a `manifest.yml` is not required but it makes things
    simpler.

Next add an `"engines"` top-level entry to your `package.json`
file:

```json
  "engines": {
    "node": "8.x.x",
    "npm": "5.x.x"
  }
```

Finally, start the deployment with:

```
cf push
```

[cf-manifest]: https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html (Cloud Foundry manifest.yml)

## Docker

Shipping your automation client as a Docker image allows you to package
up all required tools and dependencies. This is especially useful if you
plan on reusing existing scripts or command line tools in your automations.

To set up a Docker image build, you need a `Dockerfile`. Read the
documentation on [building Docker images][docker-build] for more
details.

```
FROM node:8

# Create application directory
RUN mkdir -p /app
WORKDIR /app

# Install application dependencies
COPY package.json /app/
RUN npm install

# Bundle app source
COPY . /app

ENV SUPPRESS_NO_CONFIG_WARNING true
ENV NPM_CONFIG_LOGLEVEL warn
ENV NODE_ENV production

EXPOSE 2866

CMD [ "npm", "start" ]
```

Be sure to create `.dockerignore` to exclude files
and directories that aren't needed at runtime.

```
/node_modules
```

With the `Dockerfile` in place, you can now start the 
actual Docker build:

```
npm run compile && \
    docker build . -t lifecycle-automation:0.1.0
```

After the build completes successfully, you can push the
image to any Docker image registry:

```
docker push lifecycle-automation:0.1.0
```
