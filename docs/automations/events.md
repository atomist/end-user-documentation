# Event Handlers

In addition to triggering an automation directly via command handlers, you can have them triggered based on events. Atomist listens to your infrastructure and recognizes changes like new pull requests, updated issues, failed builds and much more. Hooks for taking action when these events occur are provided by Event Handlers. You can create your own event handlers to make Atomist react however you want. Let's write one.

To create your own event handlers, youâ€™ll need an automation client of your own [LINK to quick start] and an event you want to react to. Our event handler will take the action of notifying us in Slack when there is a new GitHub issue .

## Events

First we need to understand the events involved. We can [use GraphiQL to query for events](graphql.md#accessing-data-with-graphiql). Lets try searching for GitHub issues. This query shows the issue number and title for all of our issues.

```
{
  Issue {
    number
    title
  }
}
```

Events can have relationships when it makes sense, even between different systems. Issues are related to their repo of course, but GitHub repos can also have Slack channels that they are associated with [LINK to associating slack channel with repo?). We can get all the information about these relationships in one query.

```
{
  Issue {
    number
    title
    repo {
      owner
      name
      channels {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This results in the data we want but we can do even better. Ideally we would like to grab all the data we need but nothing more. We don't want to have to make additional queries, but we also don't want to have to filter down the results. In this case we don't want all the issues, just the open ones. We can use GraphQL to get exactly that.

```
{
  Issue(state: open) {
    number
    title
    repo {
      owner
      name
      channels {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

There are a lot of interesting events and convenient relationships between them. [LINK to a catalog of event types somewhere, maybe the lifecycle schema if nothing else?] Hopefully this gets you interested in searching your builds, releases, Slack channels, comments and more. But for now let's use this query to write our event handler.

## Event handler structure

Here is a complete event handler that listens for new issues and notifies us. This is putting together a lot of pieces that you have likely already seen.

```typescript
import {EventHandler} from "@atomist/automation-client/decorators";
import {EventFired, HandleEvent} from "@atomist/automation-client/HandleEvent";
import {HandlerContext} from "@atomist/automation-client/HandlerContext";
import {failure, HandlerResult, Success} from "@atomist/automation-client/HandlerResult";

@EventHandler("Notify channel on new issue",
    `subscription IssueNotification
{
  Issue(state: open) {
    number
    title
    repo {
      owner
      name
      channels {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}`)
export class IssueNotification implements HandleEvent<Issues> {
    public handle(e: EventFired<Issues>, ctx: HandlerContext): Promise<HandlerResult> {
        const issue = e.data.Issue[0];
        return ctx.messageClient.addressChannels(
            `New issue: #${issue.number} '${issue.title}' in ${issue.repo.owner}.${issue.repo.name}`,
            issue.repo.channels.map(c => c.name)
        )
            .then(() => Success)
            .catch(err => failure(err));
    }
}

export interface Issues {
    Issue: [{
        number: number;
        title: string;
        repo: {
            owner: string;
            name: string;
            channels: [{
                name: string;
            }]
        }
    }]
}
```

The @EventHandler decorator allows you to provide a description and a query to subscribe to. You will notice the GraphQL that we built up in the previous section. You can [define the subscription GraphQL query inline or reference a file](graphql.md#subscriptions). It also implements HandleEvent which specifies the handle method. This is where your automation code goes. Every matching event triggers the code here. From here you have access to the event itself with EventFired and a [HandlerContext for interacting with Slack or querying more events](commands.md#what-do-you-get). While a command handler has @Parameters and @MappedParamters to specify the details on invocation, an event handler does not. Instead it acts on the data inside the event. It can have [@Secrets](commands.md#secrets) though to specify details you don't want in your code.

In this example specifically, we use the HandlerContext to send a message about the new issue to any associated channels it has. Most of the work was done just by the subscription query with the data we needed. The Issues interface exists merely for the convenience have having a typed EventFired, but there are ways to generate this type implicitly from the GraphQL schema. We return a [HandlerResult](commands.md#what-do-you-give-back) based on the success of the operation. (say something about what can be done with the result, are failures just logged?).

# Register and trigger the handler

Register this event handler by addinfg it to atomist.config.ts.

```typescript
export const configuration: Configuration = {
    events: [
        () => new IssueNotification(),
    ]
}
```

Restart your automation client and create a new GitHub issue to see the Slack notification. This is cool, but we are not limited to mere notification. You can do whatever you want in that handle method with the event data. But before we get carried away, make sure you unit test your event handler.

# Unit test

Event handlers run in the background based on incoming events. You want to test it to be sure that it does what you expect in various cases. Luckily, event handlers are very unit testable. Here is a test for our issue notification event handler.

```typescript
import { EventFired } from "@atomist/automation-client/HandleEvent";
import { HandlerContext } from "@atomist/automation-client/HandlerContext";
import { guid } from "@atomist/automation-client/internal/util/string";
import { MessageOptions } from "@atomist/automation-client/spi/message/MessageClient";
import { MessageClientSupport } from "@atomist/automation-client/spi/message/MessageClientSupport";
import { SlackMessage } from "@atomist/slack-messages/SlackMessages";
import "mocha";
import * as assert from "power-assert";
import { IssueNotification } from "../../../../src/tutorial/lessons/events/IssueNotification";

describe("IssueNotification", () => {

    const payloadNewIssue = `{
	"data": {
		"Issue": [{
			"number": 123,
			"title": "another bug to fix",
			"repo": {
			    "owner": "negan",
			    "name": "saviors",
			    "channels": [
			        {
			            "name": "water-cooler-talk"
			        }
			    ]
			}
		}]
	}
}`;

    const handler = new IssueNotification();

    it("notifies channel", done => {
        class FakeMessageClient extends MessageClientSupport {
            protected doSend(msg: string | SlackMessage, userNames: string | string[],
                             channelNames: string | string[], options?: MessageOptions): Promise<any> {
                assert.deepEqual(msg, "New issue: #123 'another bug to fix' in negan.saviors");
                assert.deepEqual(channelNames, ["water-cooler-talk"]);
                return Promise.resolve();
            }
        }
        const ctx: HandlerContext = {
            teamId: "teamId1",
            correlationId: "correlationId1",
            invocationId: guid(),
            graphClient: undefined,
            messageClient: new FakeMessageClient(),
        };
        handler.handle(JSON.parse(payloadNewIssue) as EventFired<any>, ctx)
            .then(done, done);
    });

});
```

To test our event handler we simply call the handle method with an event payload like it might see in the wild. Notice that instead of actually sending a message, we provide a FakeMessageClient (via the HandlerContext) where we assert about the way the message would be sent. A real test should exercise other test cases that are not necessarily the happy path.
