# How to Configure your Atomist Experience

Your user experience with Atomist's out-of-the-box features can be configured using the settings specified in a `atomist-config` repository for a particular GitHub organisation.

Atomist does not require you to have an `atomist-config` repository unless you want to specify your own configuration options. To set up a default `atomist-config` directory you can use the built-in Atomist command `@atomist create org config`.
