Atomist surfaces relevant and actionable information about what's going on in your
 software development wherever you and your team are working. One really collaborative place 
 is in [Slack][slack] and Atomist integrates with Slack via the Atomist Bot to give 
 you a chat-based interface to Atomist's capabilities.

The following video shows how you can enroll the Atomist bot to your Slack team:

Let's walk through the steps in the above video. First, invite the Atomist Bot into your Slack team by clicking on the `Add to Slack` button below:

<div class="ss-container">
  <a href="https://atm.st/2wiDlUe" onclick="trackOutboundLink('https://atm.st/2wiDlUe'); return false;" target="_blank">
                    <img alt="Add to Slack" height="50" width="174" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x" />
  </a>
</div>

Clicking the button will send you to a web page where you will be
asked to sign into your Slack team if you are not already signed in.
Provide your Slack team domain and click Continue.

On the next page, provide your email address and password to complete
the Slack sign-in.  If you have trouble signing in, check
out [Slack help][slack-help].

After successfully signing in, you will see the authorization page for
the Atomist app, including the Slack permissions requested.  Confirm
that the correct Slack team is selected and click "Authorize".

For information on the permissions requested, see [Slack Permissions][slack-perm].

[slack-perm]: /user-guide/permissions/slack.md (Atomist Slack Permissions)

<!-- TODO verify this is still the case -->
Once you have successfully authorized the Atomist Bot in your Slack
team, you will be redirected to a confirmation page.  You can close
this page and go back to Slack to continue this guide.

By default, the Atomist Bot will be named `@atomist` and will join the
`#general` channel in your Slack team.  You can invite the Atomist Bot
into any other channel in the same way you would invite any other
user: an `@` mention and invite, the `/invite @atomist` command, or
via the channel settings > "Invite team members to join ...".

For a complete list of the things the Atomist Bot can do, send the bot
a `help` message.
